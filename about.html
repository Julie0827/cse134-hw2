        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Hi, I'm Julie! I'm a fourth-year Computer Science student at UC San Diego. I love learning new things, especially when it comes to tech. Some of my favorite classes so far have been <strong>Operating Systems</strong> and <strong>Computer Networks</strong>, and lately, I’ve been diving deeper into OS in my free time.</p>
        <p>Outside of school, I love reading sci-fi books, and <em>Ready Player One</em> is one of my all-time favorites. I also love animals—I have a puppy, and she means the world to me!</p>
        <p>I really enjoy studying on campus with my friends, and we always end up at <strong>Franklin Antonio Hall</strong>, our favorite spot. I'm also part of the <strong>Competitive Programming Club</strong>, where I help out as the Marketing Director.</p>
        <p>As for my career path, I’m still figuring things out, but for now, I’m just enjoying learning, coding, and spending time with the people I love.</p>
        
        <details>
            <summary>More About My Background</summary>
            <p>I’m originally from South Korea, and my journey to studying in the U.S. has taken me through a few different places. I spent a few months in New York before moving to California, where I lived in Pleasant Hill in the Bay Area for three years. Eventually, I made my way to San Diego to attend UCSD. I’ve loved all the cities I’ve lived in, but San Diego has been my favorite.</p>

        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>I'm comfortable working with <strong>C++, Java, Python, and C</strong>, and I also have experience with <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>, though I'm still improving my web development skills. I’ve worked with <strong>Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn</strong>, along with <strong>YOLOv8</strong> and <strong>PyTorch</strong> for machine learning tasks. I’ve also learned <strong>Docker</strong> for containerization and have experience working in <strong>Linux and macOS environments</strong>. In addition, I have some experience with <strong>x86 Assembly</strong> and an understanding of <strong>operating systems concepts</strong> like process management and memory allocation.</p>

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>As a <strong>Research Assistant</strong> for the <strong>Avocado Computer Vision Project</strong> at <strong>UC San Diego</strong> (Aug 2024 – Present), I have contributed to improving avocado tree detectionin images using YOLOv8 for precision agriculture applications. My work involves preparing datasets in a YOLO-compatible format, ensuring proper data cleaning and directory structuring. Additionally, I have trained and evaluated YOLOv8 models with different configurations to optimize recall and precision.</p>

        <h3>Job Preferences</h3>
        <p>I haven't decided on a specific career path yet, but I see every opportunity as a chance to learn and grow. I'm particularly interested in <strong>systems-related roles</strong>, such as <strong>operating systems</strong> and <strong>computer networks</strong>, but I’m also open to working in <strong>backend or frontend development</strong>. I currently live in <strong>San Diego</strong>, so I’d prefer opportunities in the area, but I’m also open to <strong>remote positions</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Welcome to the Experiments section!</h3>
            <p>This part of the site is separate from my portfolio and is meant for testing HTML tags that don’t naturally fit elsewhere. <strong>The goal is to explore different elements as part of Homework 2.</strong> Thanks for stopping by!</p>
            
            <div class="experiment">
                <p>The tags I’m testing here are &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;. My professor mentioned that these tags are purely presentational, so for semantic purposes, we should use &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt; instead.</p>
                <p>Now, here’s an example of <b>bold</b> and <i>italic</i> text using &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;!</p>
