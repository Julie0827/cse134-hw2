        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Hi, I'm Julie! I'm a fourth-year Computer Science student at UC San Diego. I love learning new things, especially when it comes to tech. Some of my favorite classes so far have been <strong>Operating Systems</strong> and <strong>Computer Networks</strong>, and lately, I’ve been diving deeper into OS in my free time.</p>
        <p>Outside of school, I love reading sci-fi books, and <cite>Ready Player One</cite> is one of my all-time favorites. I also love animals—I have a puppy, and she means <em>the world</em> to me!</p>
        <p>I really enjoy studying on campus with my friends, and we always end up at <strong>Franklin Antonio Hall</strong>, our favorite spot. I'm also part of the <strong>Competitive Programming Club</strong>, where I help out as the Marketing Director. Our club competes in the <abbr title="International Collegiate Programming Contest">ICPC</abbr> and helps students improve problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.</p>
        <p>As for my career path, I’m still figuring things out, but for now, I’m just enjoying learning, coding, and spending time with the people I love.</p>
        
        <details>
            <summary>More About My Background</summary>
            <p>I’m originally from South Korea, and my journey to studying in the U.S. has taken me through a few different places. I spent a few months in New York before moving to California, where I lived in Pleasant Hill in the Bay Area for three years. Eventually, I made my way to San Diego to attend UCSD. I’ve loved all the cities I’ve lived in, but San Diego has been my favorite.</p>

        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>I'm comfortable working with <strong>C++, Java, Python, and C</strong>, and I also have experience with <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>, though I'm still improving my web development skills. I’ve worked with <strong>Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn</strong>, along with <strong>YOLOv8</strong> and <strong>PyTorch</strong> for machine learning tasks. I’ve also learned <strong>Docker</strong> for containerization and have experience working in <strong>Linux and macOS environments</strong>. In addition, I have some experience with <strong>x86 Assembly</strong> and an understanding of <strong>operating systems concepts</strong> like process management and memory allocation.</p>
        
        <hr>
        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>As a <strong>Research Assistant</strong> for the <strong>Avocado Computer Vision Project</strong> at <strong>UC San Diego</strong> (Aug 2024 – Present), I have contributed to improving avocado tree detectionin images using YOLOv8 for precision agriculture applications. My work involves preparing datasets in a YOLO-compatible format, ensuring proper data cleaning and directory structuring. Additionally, I have trained and evaluated YOLOv8 models with different configurations to optimize recall and precision.</p>

        <h3>Job Preferences</h3>
        <p>I haven't decided on a specific career path yet, but I see every opportunity as a chance to learn and grow. I'm particularly interested in <strong>systems-related roles</strong>, such as <strong>operating systems</strong> and <strong>computer networks</strong>, but I’m also open to working in <strong>backend or frontend development</strong>. I currently live in <strong>San Diego</strong>, so I’d prefer opportunities in the area, but I’m also open to <strong>remote positions</strong>.</p>

                <p>Hi, my name is <del>Joohee</del> <ins>Julie</ins> Hong, and I live in <del>Pleasant Hill</del> <ins>San Diego</ins>!</ins></p>
                
                <p>Here are my top three favorite foods that always make me happy:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Avocado</li>
                    <li>Chocolate</li>
                    <li>Boba</li>
                </ol>

                My professor mentioned that these tags are purely presentational, so for semantic purposes, we should use &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt; instead.</p>
                <p>Now, here’s an example of <b>bold</b> and <i>italic</i> text using &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;!</p>

                <p>I plan to include code snippets on my project page as part of my demonstration, but since I’m still working on my website and haven’t decided what to add yet, I’ll use this space to practice the &lt;code&gt; tag. I’m sure it’ll be useful!</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        #include &lt;iostream&gt;
                        using namespace std;

                        int main() {
                            count &lt;&lt; "Hello World!";
                            return 0;
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                
                <p>I want to share a pohto of my puppy because she brings me so much joy!</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="assets/my_puppy.jpg" alt="My puppy in a pink t-shirt">
                    <figcaption>Here's my puppy! She's the cutest, and I love her so much.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>Here’s another photo of my puppy, but this time, I used the <picture> tag to display it in three different sizes based on the screen width.</p>
                <picture>
                    <source srcset="assets/puppy-large.png" media="(min-width: 1000px)">
                    <source srcset="assets/puppy-medium.png" media="(min-width: 600px)">
                    <img src="assets/puppy-small.png" alt="My puppy in a pink sweater">
                </picture>
                
                <p>Here’s one of my favorite quotes:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."
                    <cite>— Albert Einstein</cite>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Here are some key terms I learned in my CSE 120 Operating Systems class:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Paging</dt>
                    <dd>A way for the OS to manage memory by dividing it into fixed-size pages.</dd>
                    
                    <dt>Condition Variable</dt>
                    <dd>A tool used in multithreading to help threads wait for a condition before continuing.</dd>
                </dl>
                <p>One key concept I learned in my OS class is <dfn>multithreading</dfn>, which allows a program to run multiple tasks at the same time, improving performance and efficiency.</p>
